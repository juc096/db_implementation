JSONParser is a class that takes in a file input (a file in json format) and parses the elements such that it can be stored into a data model class. The JSONParser class itself, however, does not dictate how the data model should be structured. That responsibility belongs to the JSONListener object. The parsing function requires a JSONListener object to "listen" and act accordingly to the elements that are being parsed.

The type of elements is dictated by the character type of the file:

	* '{' denotes an object to be created, '}' denotes the end of this object
	* '[' denotes an array to be created, ']' denotes the end of this array
	* '"' denotes the start of a constant string value, '"' denotes the end of this value.

For example, when the parser encounters the '{' character, it will know that this is the beginning of an object container, and will ask the JSONListener to handle this container opening, through the "handleOpenContainer" function. 

It will then continually parse the file by obtaining the inner elements of this object container and telling the JSONListener that there are more elements to add into this container.

When it encounters the '}' character, it knows this object has no more elements inside, and will ask the JSONListener to handle the closing of the container.
